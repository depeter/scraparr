**Probable JavaScript Rendering:**
- Most modern platforms use React/Vue
- Expect client-side rendering
- May need headless browser (Playwright/Puppeteer)

**Anti-Scraping Challenges:**
- Ticketmaster: Known for bot protection (Cloudflare, DataDome)
- CTS Eventim: Moderate protection
- Smaller platforms: Usually easier

### Geographic Event Distribution

**Highest Event Density:**
1. UK (London specifically)
2. Germany (distributed: Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Cologne)
3. France (Paris-centric but good regional coverage)
4. Spain (Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia)
5. Italy (Milan, Rome, distributed)

**Festival Hotspots:**
- **Electronic**: Netherlands, Croatia, Albania, Portugal
- **Rock**: Germany, UK, Czech Republic
- **Cultural**: Belgium (Flanders), France, Austria

### Language Considerations

**Multi-lingual Platforms (Priority):**
- Switzerland (DE/FR/IT)
- Belgium (NL/FR)
- Luxembourg (FR/DE)
- Finland (FI/SE)
- Spain (ES/Catalan/Basque/Galician regional events)
